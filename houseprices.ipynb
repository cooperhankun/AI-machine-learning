    "\r\n",
    "Set a target problem you want to solve. For example, the goal of the analysis is to find the base line factor affecting the value of house holds in California. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "There are two main ways to obtain data: (1). loading stored data from local computer (2). the external source data which published on the website or collected through web crawlers.  \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The most commonly used file format is .csv. A CSV (comma-separated values) file is a simple text file in which information is separated by commas. \r\n",

    "Taking the data of California housing prices as an example, we can first download the housing.csv file from the website and save it in the datasets folder. \r\n",

    "# 2. Data loading \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Extract data from databases and files and turn them into DataFrame objects. We can open the data through the library:  import pandas as pd -> x=pd.read_csv('C:\\\\...housing.csv')\r\n",

    "Convert datasets structure into chart form ( here we can use matplotlib library). \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The common way for example is the histogram for showing the distribution of the variables. Make a correlation matrix and look for the correlations. \r\n",

    "Data: the data we want or the independent variables, as known as x variables. \r\n",

    "## Data preparation, conversion and aggregation: \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "By using the describe data function to check if there are missing values or outliers. Some empty data can be filled or deleted according to some situation. We can choose to drop one or several feature variables if there are some terrible missing. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Clean the data, make the format consistently, some symbols must be removed, convert categorical and text data to numeric data.  \r\n",

    "Define or split the data into training part and test part. For example 67% for training and 33% for test, x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Train the model with training data and predict on the test data.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Do the coefficients analysis.\r\n",
